# Project Motivation
I essentially want to find kubernetes issues that serve as a good entry points to k8s projects while I try and figure out what i want to do in k8s. 

This project returns a list of good first issues to work on sorted by the when they were created so you get the most relevant issues first.

Also wanted to play with go html templating a bit go is so cool it has everything!
# Running the project 
Create a github personal access token with read rights. 

```bash
export GITHUB_PAT="ghp_your_personal_access_token_here"
```


Then start up with server with 
```
go run main.go
```

then you will have a list of github issues :)
